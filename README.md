ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David Kloepper. 

By day, I'm a business consultant with Adobe Experience Cloud. 
By night, I'm pursuing my masters in applied business analytics at the University of Minnesota, Carlson School of Management (May 2023).

Most of the work on this repository is output from homework and projects created during Data Visualization Bootcamp through the U of M School of Continuing Education in 2019.
