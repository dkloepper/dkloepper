ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David Kloepper. 

By day, I'm a business consultant with Adobe Experience Cloud. 
By night, I'm pursuing my masters in applied business analytics at the University of Minnesota, Carlson School of Management (May 2023).

Most of the work in these respositories are outputs from homework and projects created during Data Visualization Bootcamp through the U of MN School of Continuing Education in 2019 and Masters of Applied Business Analytics from 2021 - 2023. Anything else is my own explorations.
